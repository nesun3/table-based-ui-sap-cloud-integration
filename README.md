## About this tool

As an SAP PO developer, you’re no stranger to the importance of message monitoring. It’s your go-to tool for understanding what’s happening in your SAP landscape. If you’ve had experience with SAP Process Orchestration (PO), you will be familiar with the Message Status Overview, which serves as your gateway to message monitoring. This invaluable tool simplifies the process of searching for messages and identifying errors. However, when you transition to SAP Cloud Integration (CPI), you might find yourself missing the simplicity and convenience of SAP PO’s Message Monitoring Overview. SAP PO Message monitoring overview and its equivalent is not present currently on SAP Cloud Integration / CPI. The look and feel and the navigation process is quite different as it built on top of SAP UI5.

To bridge the gap between SAP PO’s Message Monitoring Overview and the SAP Cloud Integration Monitor Message Processing and to provide a monitoring experience comparable to the familiar SAP PO Message Monitoring Overview, I have created a user-friendly solution called the **Table-Based UI**. This solution is crafted to provide you with all the necessary information to facilitate your daily tasks and simplify message monitoring, much like the experience in SAP PO. It is entirely designed using the fundamental building blocks and artifacts of SAP Cloud Integration, harnessing the inherent capabilities of the platform, and utilizing the power of the Groovy Markup Builder. This approach ensures that the solution aligns more closely with the platform’s core development style and pushing the boundaries of what can be accomplished within this framework.

Additionally, I have broadened this approach to include Integration Artifacts and Content, making it your go-to tool for gaining comprehensive insights into all integration contents within your sub-account.

**Here’s a sneak-peak to the solution:**
