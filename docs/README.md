| Integration Artifacts UI | This integration flow will generate an HTML page as a response, providing detailed insights into all or specific Integration Artifacts in the sub-account in a table-based format. The endpoint for accessing this information is /http/integration-artifacts.                                    |
| Integration Assets UI    | This integration flow will generate an HTML page as a response, providing detailed insights into all or specific Integration Assets (such as External Parameter & Resources) in the sub-account in a table-based format.

**Some Key Points:**

1. Since the output is an API response in HTML, you will need a REST API client like Insomnia by Kong, Postman, etc.
1. The solution has been tested specifically with the REST API clients Insomnia by Kong and Postman. Both have some limitations and corresponding workarounds, which will be discussed later.
1. While it is recommended to use either Insomnia by Kong or Postman as your REST API client, it is not mandatory. You can opt for a REST API client of your preference; however, ensure that it supports the preview/rendering of HTML pages. For instance, the Advanced Rest Client provides responses in HTML but lacks a preview option. In such cases, a workaround is to download and save the response as an *.html file, then drag and drop the HTML file into the browser of your choice.


The mentioned integration flow will generate an HTML page as a response. To preview the HTML page using Postman or Insomnia by Kong, please refer to the corresponding collection name in the table below. [Download](https://github.com/nesun3/table-based-ui-sap-cloud-integration/tree/main/build) the Postman or Insomnia collection.
